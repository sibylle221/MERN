#Propel Health
##"Healthcare, in your hands"

This project was created for the purposes of the Final Year Project, a requirement for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree offered by TU Dublin.

Propel Health is an application that aims to improve the efficiency of care provided in healthcare facilities as well as serve to improve patient empowerment. This project's design and development was shaped by stakeholder feedback and ensured the securement of sensitive data through the use of encryption, authenication and abstraction.

Propel Health is a dynamic web application built using MERN stack architecture, with additional items such as axios, redux, chakra and toastify.

This project has been dockerised and hosted on DigitalOcean.

Sensitive information such as the JWT key and Mongo URI have not been included in the docker compose file of this version of Propel Health for security reasons.

It is accessible online through the domain name "propelhealth.online".
